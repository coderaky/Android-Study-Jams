# Noite
## Android Study Jam
It is Android application written in Kotlin to create, store and manage your notes.

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Between the internet, cell phones, and all sorts of other technology, business today is entirely different than it has been. Projects are bigger, results are faster (even for the competition), and the corresponding workload associated with a successful company is larger than ever. To be sure, even relatively simple tasks require ample attentiveness and multi-faceted plans to complete.
That’s where keeping notes, as well as the general idea of breaking Big info down into smaller and easier-to-handle chunks,  come into perspective.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

This project proposed as “Noite” , Besides relieving much of the stress encountered when tackling complex tasks, making it simpler to verify that each and every step has been completed. Finally, it becomes possible to verify the quality of each of these steps, take notes of each Over time, as more and more tasks are completed with the assistance of taking notes, the overall work helps to create remarkable large-scale projects and accomplishments. In other words, the sky is the limit for results produced by taking notes

- MVVM and Architecture components are used.

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

The app is currently in testing phase with MMMUT(Google Developer Students Club,mmmut) University with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : [YOUR APP LINK HERE](G-drive lik).

Once the app is fully tested and functional in MMMUT, we plan to talk to other technical clubs of our college to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this To-do app.
